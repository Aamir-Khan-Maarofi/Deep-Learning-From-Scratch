# Deep-Learning-From-Scratch
This repository include implementation of Deep Learning algorithms from scrath. In programming there is always a kind of abstraction, in this implementation my approach is not naive programming. I will be using NumPy for vector operations and matplotlib for visualization. I will be updating this list as I push new code. So far following are implemented. 
## 1. Multilayer Perceptron:
Multilayer perceptron with backpropagation algorithm is implemented and can be found in **Multi-Layer-Perceptron** subfolder.
